# GestureScript Language (GSL)
The World's First Programming Sign Language

## Introduction
GSL is a revolutionary programming language that breaks through limits by enabling developers to code using gestures and sign language. GSL is a [esoteric programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language) that is [turring complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness). The project is still under heavy development. If you enjoy the project, give the repo a ‚≠ê.
